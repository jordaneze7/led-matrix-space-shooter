Imperator - Arduino Space Shooter Game
A retro-style space shooter game designed for Arduino with RGB LED matrix display. Navigate your ship, dodge incoming enemies, and rack up points in this classic arcade-inspired experience!
üéÆ Game Features

Classic Space Shooter Gameplay: Move your ship vertically and horizontally while shooting at incoming enemies
Progressive Difficulty: Game speed increases every 20 points, making survival increasingly challenging
Lives System: Start with 5 lives, lose one when enemies reach you or collide with your ship
High Score Tracking: Persistent high score storage using EEPROM memory
Multi-Projectile System: Fire up to 5 bullets simultaneously
Enemy AI: Smart enemy spawning with randomized positions and timing
Bonus Lives: Earn extra lives every level milestone
Cheat Codes: Hidden debug features for testing (can be disabled)

üõ† Hardware Requirements
Essential Components

Arduino Board (Uno, Mega, or compatible)
64x32 RGB LED Matrix with appropriate driver
7 Push Buttons for game controls
Pull-up resistors for button inputs
Power supply capable of driving the LED matrix

Pin Configuration
cppButton Controls:
- BTN_UP (Pin 35): Move ship up
- BTN_DOWN (Pin 30): Move ship down  
- BTN_LEFT (Pin 36): Move ship left
- BTN_RIGHT (Pin 34): Move ship right

- BTN_C (Pin 32): Fire weapon
üìö Required Libraries
Install these libraries through the Arduino IDE Library Manager:
cpp#include <MOMO_RGB_Matrix.h>  // RGB Matrix control
#include <Bounce2.h>          // Button debouncing
#include <EEPROM.h>          // High score storage
üéØ How to Play
Game Controls

Arrow Buttons: Move your ship up, down, left, right
Button C: Fire projectiles at enemies
Buttons A/B: Navigate menus and restart game

Gameplay Mechanics

Objective: Survive as long as possible while destroying enemies
Scoring: +1 point per enemy destroyed
Lives: Start with 5 lives, gain 1 life every 20 points
Levels: Difficulty increases every 20 points
Game Over: When all lives are lost

Game States

Title Screen: Shows game name and high score
Active Game: Main gameplay with enemies, bullets, and interface
Game Over: Displays final score and level reached
Reset: Automatically returns to title screen

üîß Installation & Setup

Hardware Assembly:

Connect RGB LED matrix to Arduino following MOMO_RGB_Matrix library documentation
Wire 7 push buttons to specified pins with pull-up resistors
Ensure adequate power supply for LED matrix

üé® Game Graphics
The game uses custom bitmap graphics for:

Player Ship: 7x3 pixel purple spacecraft
Enemy Ships: 6x3 pixel orange/yellow enemies
Projectiles: Single red pixels
UI Elements: Score, lives, and level display

üèÜ Scoring System

+1 Point: Each enemy destroyed
+1 Life: Every 20 points earned
Level Up: Every 20 points (increases enemy speed)
High Score: Automatically saved to EEPROM memory

üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues

Display Problems: Check matrix wiring and power supply
Button Issues: Verify pull-up resistors and pin connections
Game Too Fast/Slow: Adjust speed constants in configuration
Memory Issues: Ensure adequate RAM for large enemy arrays

Debug Features

Serial output available at 115200 baud rate
Cheat codes can be used for testing gameplay mechanics
